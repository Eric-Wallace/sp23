## Course Info 

This course will consist of two parts. In the first part, taught by Professor Dan Klein, we will explore traditional statistical techniques for natural language processing. The dominant modeling paradigm here is corpus-driven statistical learning. We will have projects to give hands-on experience with a variety of NLP tasks and commonly-used techniques.

In the second part, taught primarily by Eric Wallace and Kevin Lin, we will discuss large language models such as GPT-3 and Codex. Here, we will introduce the basic of these models and then move to discuss cutting-edge research on various threads (e.g., the training, use, misuse of LLMs).

This course assumes a good background in basic machine learning and a strong ability to program in Python. Prior experience with linguistics or natural languages is helpful, but not required. There will be a lot of statistics, algorithms, and coding in this class. The recommended background is CS 188 (or CS 281A) and CS 170 (or CS 270). An A in CS 188 (or CS 281A) is required. This course will be more work-intensive than most graduate or undergraduate courses.
